CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:6 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findopen62541.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project
  has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "open62541", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "open62541" with
  any of the following names:

    open62541Config.cmake
    open62541-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "open62541" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "open62541_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "open62541" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has
  been installed.
